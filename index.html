										<h2>Who?</h2>
										<p>An aspiring software engineer who knows how to pour a mean esspresso.

									<br><p>It all started when my best friend in high school, who I met through working at the same coffee shop, started his freshman year majoring in computer science. He started college two years earlier than me and peaked my interest in computers. Soon after, I began getting interested in computer hardware and even upgraded some components in my first ever desktop, a dell dimension 2400. Suddenly, I was my neighborhoods' IT solution specialist and started realizing that my problem solving skills can also be applied to coding. Ever since then, my passion for programming has manifested into pursuing a career in the computer science field.   </p>

												<h4>NYITFace</h4>
												<p>Implemented a face recognition app, that is supposed to replace the school ID card, during my undergrad research program. My teammates and I compared the eigen algorithm and fishman algorithm for training faces. We also created a UI to log in with a personal school ID number. The app would return an animated school logo if you were a verified attending student and if not a verified student, return a picture of an angry face. </p>

												<h4>Patient Manager</h4>
												<p>Coded a Java program in my early school years for hospital use. The patient manager was a simple UI connected to a SQL database. Functions include: adding new patient info, updating old patient info, deleting patient info, and showing initial and last visit. </p>

												<h4>Budgetting application using ReactJS/Redux</h4>
												<p>During an effort to learn more ReactJS and Redux, I created a budgetting application that allows you to enter a set budget and then shows you how much of your budget is left aftering entering whatever you have spent. I also created a log-in/sign-up page; however, the back end is not connected so I used the react router to route you to the home page after clicking sign in. Also, I wanted to create a dynamic pie chart that would categories what you have spent to visually show what your are spending most of your money on. I have yet to figure out how to update the pie chart using chartjs so, there is just a static pie chart on the page. </p>
